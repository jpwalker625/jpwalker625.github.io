**Modeling is a process.**

Starting with an **idea**, you...
   
* Design a model  
* Train the model using data  
* Evaluate the model using new data  
* Test the model performance by comparing to other models
* Interpret how the model challenges your ideas...

This process can be cyclical and your model interpretations may lead to new ideas or models.
