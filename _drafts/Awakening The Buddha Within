"How can you help others if you cannot help yourself? Liberate yourself and you liberate the world." 

"Open your heart and awaken your mind, and you'll be there."

-Lama Yeshe, p.9

## Awakening the Buddha Within

Truth is found by living truly -- in your own authentic way. -p.15

## Innate Awareness is the Natural State

In Pali, the original language of Buddha scriptures, the word Buddha literally means *awake*. p.17

## Today, Right Now

We keep looking outside for answers. We look for lovers, friends, parents, authorities, and even children to answer needs they can't possibly fulfill... In truth, unrealistic expectations tarnish our apprecieation of life and weigh down the buoyancy of the present moment. -p.19

What we seek, we already are. p.20

The spontaneous fullness that is known as Buddha-nature is always open and flowing. It is not static, it is ecstatic. -p.20

> Breathe. Breathe Again. Smile. Relax. Arrive. Where you are. Be natural. Open to effortlessness, To being Rather than doing. Drop everything. Let go. Enjoy for a moment This marvelous joy of meditation.


## A Tibetan Prophecy

The word Dharma is frequently used as a synontm for Buddha Dharma, the teachings of the compassionate enlightened Buddha, the founder of Buddhism who lived in the fifth centur B.C. in northern India. 

Dharma is a Sankrit word with a complex meaning. It can be translated as teaching, truth, doctrine, religion, spirituality, or reality. It's literal meaning is "that which supports or upholds." Another, lesser-known meaning of Dharma is "that which remedies, alleviates, heals, and restores." On the very deepest level, the truths embodied in Dharma teaching heal what ails us.   -p.25

"What did the Dalai Lama say to the New York hot dog vendor?"
"Make me *one* with everything." -p.26

## East Goes West/West Goes East

...Westerners had an affinity for Buddhism because they didn't believe anything until it was proven. The Buddha, he reminded me, told people not to follow anything blindly, for Buddhism is not based on belief so much as rational experiment. If, like a scientist, you replicated Buddha's experiment, you should get the same good results -- enlightenment.   -p.33

## Sonada Monastery

In Tibet, of course, it is taught that animals are also sentient beings and, like humans, evolve through lifetime after lifetime. They too are endowed with Buddha-nature and the potential for enlightenment.
-p.37

## Finding Your Own Truth, Your Own Dharma Gate

The truth, after all, belongs to anyone who cherishes it, lives it, loves it, and is committed to it. -p.42
