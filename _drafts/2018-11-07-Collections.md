Creating and Adding Collections to your site.

_recipes is where the .md files will go

recipes.md is the page where you will go to see all the recipes contained in the collection
(front matter needs the layout, permalink, etc...)

_config.yml needs to have the collection declared as well as any other info. associated with it.
