## It's easy to sound smart

I recently saw a post on Linkedin from a CEO who wrote about an interesting finding by a renowned academic institute followed by their own personal comments about the subject. There were no sources pointing to the original research so I tried finding it myself to no avail. I followed up by asking the OP if they could provide link(s) to the source(s) of the research/study. As a scientifically minded individual, I was curious about the original research/study. By no means was I trying to call them out. Regardless, I never heard back from the OP and I never managed to find the original study.

While having good intentions, the OP's comments could not be backed up and steered the reader toward a questionable narrative. Additionally, there were no sources leaving readers like me to wonder if there was any evidence of the study or finding being real at all.

I see this kind of post on Linkedin all too often and it's indicative of a larger theme. Regardless of one's intentions, it's far too easy to get caught up in the echo chamber of regurgitated facts and figures without doing due diligence. It's easy to sound smart.
