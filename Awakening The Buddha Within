## A Tibetan Prophecy

The word Dharma is frequently used as a synontm for Buddha Dharma, the teachings of the compassionate enlightened Buddha, the founder of Buddhism who lived in the fifth centur B.C. in northern India. 

Dharma is a Sankrit word with a complex meaning. It can be translated as teaching, truth, doctrine, religion, spirituality, or reality. It's literal meaning is "that which supports or upholds." Another, lesser-known meaning of Dharma is "that which remedies, alleviates, heals, and restores." On the very deepest level, the truths embodied in Dharma teaching heal what ails us.   -p.25

"What did the Dalai Lama say to the New York hot dog vendor?"
"Make me *one* with everything." -p.26
