# I. Beginnings
We all hope to change, to get somewhere! That in itself is the basic fallacy. But just contemplating this desire begins to clarify it, and the practice basis of your life begins to alter as we do so. We begin to comprehend that our frantic desire to get better, to "get somewhere" is illusion itself, and the source of suffering. -p24

Practice is about breaking our exclusive identification with ourselves. Purifying the mind. Stripping away that which keeps a person from functioning best. 

# II. Practice
## The Fire of Attention
Hard coal - anthracite - burns clean. This is what we strive to "burn" our attention like.

Soft coal - lignite - is the reality of how we utilize our attention. Distracted, messy and impure, often wasteful. It simply means the burning in our life is not clean.

From the bible: *He is like a refiner's fire* - p31

Attention is rthe cutting, burning, and our practice is to use that word as much as we can. p32

Remain dispassionate and fundamentally unaffected by your thoughts.

Quiet the mind, increase the air intake, allow the fire to roar.

## Pushing for Enlightenment Experiences

Be patient. Having an "enlightenment" experience too soon is not necessarily healthy.

"On a withered tree, a flower blooms" -p39

The longer we practice, the more minimal this need becomes. The love becomes greater, and the need, less. We can't love something we need" -p.39

As we identify ourselves with less and less, we cam include more and more in our lives. -p39

## The Price of Practice

When life is unpleasant or unfulfilling, we use subtle escape mechanisms to avoid feeling pain or discomfort. In this way, we attempt to find somebody or something to handle our difficulties for us.

"As long as we see our lives in this dualistic fashion, we fool ourselves and believe that we need not pay any price for a realized life. We will continue to resist practive until we understand that only we cvan pay the price of realization." -p40

We never have a real practice until we realize our unwillingness to pay any price at all. Paying the price of practice is a privilege and we see this more clearly as our practice grows. In this process we discover that our own pain and others' pain are not separate worlds. The delusion of separateness diminishes.

## The Reward of Practice

To have a self means we are "self-centered". Rather than moving from unhappy self to happy self, Zen practice can help move one from unhappy self to no self, that which is joy. 

We must, however, have some degree of happiness and stability to engage in serious practice. In the next stage we begin to see the patterns, desires, and addictions that the self is composed of. We can then work to dissolve them. 

A life of joy is not in seeking happiness, but in experiencing and simply being the circumstances of our life as they are; not in fulfilling personal wants, but in fulfilling the needs of life; not in avoiding pain, but in being pain when it is necessary to do so. -p.45

# III. Feelings
## A Bigger Container

"The gateless gate"  
  
The overriding quality in any quarrel is pride. -p49 

<mark>On being angry:  The first step is to back away, say little.</mark> -p50

Pride out of which anger is born is what separates us. -p51

What we want is not to be right, but to be a bigger container. The container is an analogy for how much life we can hold before the container overflows. As we strengthen our practice, our container grows.

What must be increased is our ability to observe. "If I can observe my mind and body in an angry state, who is this 'I' who observes. It shows me I am other than my anger, bigger than my anger. And this knowledge enables me to build a bigger container to grow." -p51

## Opening Pandora's Box

The Princess & the pea

Practice allows us to become more sensitive, but more edgy too.

Practice can be like opening Pandora's Box. All of us feel like we are separate from life. That we have a wall all around us. As we practice, that wall becomes thinner and thinner.It's like a lid slowly being lifted revealing the chaos that is life which we are connected to. The chaos is our ego and all its desires, wants, needs, etc... In this way, practice is not easy, but it is transformative and necessary.

The most painful thing is to think that there's something wrong with me, and that nobody else is having the trouble I am. That's not true, of course. -p56

## DO NOT BE ANGRY

Our encounters in life, with other people, events, are like being bumped with an empty rowboat. -p57

That's the fun of being with another person. Life's little moments, squabbles, trials and tribulations, are hilarious and perfect. But we don't alwys see it that way. We all have our cut-off point, the point at which our container begins to flow and we just can't deal with it. This is the point of our practice, to grow that container so that the things that bother us no longer do. We come to accept them as they are, perfect. 

The experiencing of anger is very quiet. Not anything noisy at all -p63

## FALSE FEAR
Fear exists because we misuse our minds, because we see our self or "I" as a separate entity.

## No Hope
It's a precious opportunity we have, to be alive as human beings. It has been said that the chance of having a human life is something like being picked up as one grain of sand out of all the grains on the beach. -p66

A life lived with no hope is a peaceful, joyous, compassionate life. All hope, of course, is about sizing up the past and projecting it into the future. There is no past and no future execpt in our mind. There is nothing but self and self is always present. -p66

Dogen Zenji's text: Tenzo Kyokun
"Other people are not me."
"If I do not do it now, when else can I do it." -p68

<mark>Nothing is wrong with dreams and fantasies. Just don't hold onto them; see their unreality and turn away.</mark> -p70

## Love
Practice is about clarifying how emotion thought melts. 

If you think you have cutoff illusory thought, the emotion thought will come up again, as though you have cut the stem of a blade of grass or trunk of a tree and left the root alive. -p71

<mark>If we're in a close relationship, from time to time we're going to be in pain because no relationship will ever suit us completely.</mark> There's no one we will ever live with who will please us in all the ways we want to be pleased. Always we must practice getting closer and closer to experiencing our pain, our disappointment, our shattered hopes and dreams. When we experience the suffering directly, the melting of the false emotion can begin and true compassion can emerge.

# IV. Relationships
## The Search
We're all looking for an ideal life. But we have to know where to look, to know what it means to look. Underneath all the looking/searching is distress, unease. These are the motivating factors of our searching.

Nothing is perfect so all of our searching is ultimately bound to end in disappointment.

Desires are inexhaustible. But you won't exhaust desires by searching; you will exhaust them by experiencing that which underlies them. 

Two questions: Do I understand the necessity for practice? Do I know what practice is?

Most people, when they get angry, act out of their thoughts; and so they nearly always have to return later and go into the experience of the upset because they're not skilled enough to do that at the time they feel threatened. -p81

## Practicing with Relationships
Action based on confusion and ignorance leads directly to more confusion, upset, and ignorance -p84

This life of ignorance is linear: past, present, and future. It is a hostile wold created by our own thoughts. And when we try to find these thoughts we dwell upon, we find it impossible because they reside in the past. They no longer exist, they are ungraspable. 

TV channel analogy - he/she is a channel 4 person. I'm calm/comfortable with channel 4. But then at some point, our partner becomes a different channel and we're not used to it. We don't like it. So we find another channel 4. But we don't ask ourselves who changed the channel in the first place. What is the source?

Sometimes people live out a lifetime and never meet. As long as our buttons are pushed, we have a great chance to learn and grow.

For those who practice paiently, there will be more and more a taste of the joy in a relationship in which no self meets no self. And when it happens, I don't even know if we can use the word "relationship". Who is there to relate to whom?

## Experiencig & Behavior

We know, to a certain extent that our behavior and our experiencing are connected. However, we constantly judge other people by their behavior without knowing their experience.

Who I am is simply experiencing itself, forever unknown. -p91

Behavior then, is what we observe. 

When we live a life that is not dominated by personal opinion but is instead pure experiencing, then we begin to take care of everyone; ourselves, and others. -p92

<mark>All of our practice is to return ourselves to pure experiencing.</mark>

## Relationships Don't Work

In everything we do in relation to other people, there is a subtle or not so subtle expectation. We all want something from the people we are in relationship to.

<mark>Love expects nothing.</mark>

A good relationship gives life more power. It has nothing to do with what you or your partner wants. 

Practice, like being in a relationship, is to be selfless. This is what it means to be strong. And strength requires flexibility.

## Relationship Is Not Each Other

The true self knows no separation. It is nothing at all, yet it is the only master.

When we are nobody, no self, the right action is obvious.

Your life is none of your business.

The true self is something like instinct. It serves not to benefit myself, or someone else, but life. 

Practice brings us into that undramatic space where things are just as they are - just functioning.
