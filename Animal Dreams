## 2) Hallie's Bones

Summer storms in the desert are violent things, and clean, they leave you feeling like you have cried. -p.8

## 3) The Flood

God, why does a mortal man have children? It is senseless to love anything this much. -p.21

## 4) Killing Chickens

When Hallie was intensely excited, she had a wild animal look to her that could stop people in their tracks. A vibration came from her skin, like a bell that had just been struck. Her hair was long and reckless, curling wildly in the humidity. Every part of my sister could stir rebellion. I was thinking that if anything happened to her I wouldn't survive. I couldn't see that there would be any methor, or any point. -p.32

The tragedy for Hallie was that there might never be a cause worth risking everything for in our lifetime. -p.36

Few people know so clearly what they want. Most people can't even think what to hope for when they throw a penny ina fountain. Almost no one really gets the chance to alter the course of human events on purpose, in the exact way they wish for it to be altered. -p.36
