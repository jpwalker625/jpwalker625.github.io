Hi, I'm Joe. In 2018, I created this website to capture my journey into the world of data science. Since then, it's evolved into a space where I can write about my life and share my thoughts. I hope you discover something interesting while you're here. Below, you can get to know more about me, or check out what I'm up to [Now](https://jpwalker625.github.io/now/).

## So who am I?

California native, currently living in the SF Bay Area.

Biotechnologist - My career resides at the crossroads of science and technology. Maintaining a thirst for knowledge and having adaptability have been the key to my success so far. For more on my career, check out my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jpwalker625).

I wear my heart on my sleeve, for better and worse.

My family and friends are most important to me.

I like working with my hands - making things, home improvement, gardening, etc.

I'm rather cerebral. I love philosophy, abstract ideas, the psyche. Though I may not seem like it as I'm very practical, logical, and orderly in my day-to-day life.

I am not religious, but I resonate with the teachings of Buddhism

Above all, I seek a balanced, peaceful life.

**Things I love:**


**Things I'm not so fond of:** 

Some of my favorite sayings:
* Everything in moderation, including moderation.
* The more you get into, the more ridiculous it gets.
