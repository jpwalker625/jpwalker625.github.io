Hi, I'm Joe. In 2018, I created this website to capture my journey into the world of data science. Since then, it's evolved into a space where I can write about my life and share my thoughts. I hope you find something cool, new, or interesting while you're here. Below, you can get to know more about me, or check out what I'm up to [Now](https://jpwalker625.github.io/now/).

This site was made with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Many thanks to the very talented Michael Rose for the [So Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) theme.
