## About Me

Hi, I'm Joe. I'm a native Californian, born and raised in the central valley. I received my Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology from UC Davis and have a certificate in Data Science from UC Berkeley Extension. My work experience spans various roles and industries including: wine making in Lodi, Napa, and New Zealand, wine sales and customer service, pharmaceutical manufacturing, as well as research and development. I currently reside in the San Francisco bay area where I have lived for the past seven years.

My data science journey began in 2014 when I joined the high throughput screening group at my current employer, [Amyris](https://amyris.com/). I first learned how to navigate databases with SQL. With data in hand, I was using software packages such as JMP, Minitab and dare I say, Excel, for statistical analysis. Fortunately, it wasn't too long before I was exposed to the wonderful world of R programming. At first, the mountain was steep; the learning process was slow going and often frustrating. With patience, persistence, and the help of my peers and other resources (Data Camp especially), evidence of improvement was gradual but undeniable. Each and every day my love and faith in data and data science expands. While I am no expert, my skills are stronger than ever and I am fortunate to be in a role where I can apply those skills to meaningful work at a company I truly believe will have a lasting positive impact on the world.

When I'm not at work, I love being active and outside whenever possible. The natural world never ceases to amaze me. Most notably, I enjoy: backpacking, climbing, cycling, photography, scuba diving, skiing, snowboarding, and yoga. 

To learn more about me and what I'm currently up to, head over to my [now](/now/) page or check out one of the links below. If you have any questions, corrections, or want to get into the weeds about a particular topic, don't hesitate to reach out. 

Thanks for visiting,  
Joe

## About Data Beta:
  
"Why Data Beta?" is a question I get asked often and I'll gladly break it down for you. First of all, I'm stoked about data. From analytics and big data, to AI and machine learning, data is integrated in our lives in so many ways. Never before has data been so comprehensively captured and mineable. And simultaneously, computing power as well as access to powerful open source tools such as R and Python continues to increase at a rapid pace. We truly are living amidst a data revolution.

The second part, 'beta', is a rock climbing term used to refer to assistance on a particular move, insight into a climb or climbing area, or more generally as a solution to some problem a climber may be facing on a route. After thinking long and hard about what to call this site, the parallels emerged between my professional and personal endeavors. What is data but a collection of information; a means to answer questions, gain insight, and of course, solve problems. Ultimately, this website is an opportunity for me to engage more personally with the data science community by sharing what I'm interested in, what I've learned, and helping any way I can. I strongly believe that to truly understand something, one should be able to teach it. I hope to reinforce what I know, and in the process, provide you with useful information. 

This site was made with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Many thanks to the very talented Michael Rose for the [So Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) theme.
