We all make them but we try to minimize them. We dwell on the little ones and beat ourselves up over the big ones. Society leads us to beleive that perfection is the key to success; our mistakes are a direct reflection of our competency and self worth. 

What defines us is not the mistakes we make but how we respond to them. As the late, great Bob Ross used to say, "We don't make mistakes, we just have happy little accidents." Mistakes are how we learn. Don't be afraid to make more of them.
