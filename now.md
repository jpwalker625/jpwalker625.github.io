Well hello again. So you want to know what I'm up to at this very moment? You've made it to the right place. 
  
NOW is an idea I adopted from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) whom I first learned about on an episode of the [Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/). It's a simple page giving you an update about what I'm currently up to, working on, and/or interested in.

## Work 
After two and a half exciting years at Benchling as an Enterprise Solutions Architect, I am back on the job market looking for my next role. I am interested in getting back into product management, data science, or ideally, a combination of both as I search for my next opportunity. 

## Health

It's been three months since my spine surgery and I'm feeling better than ever. Thanks to Dr. Bray for giving me two new discs (C6, C7) in neck and getting back on track to doing the things I love.

## Learning

JMP scripting (JSL), Python, OSIsoft Pi, oh my! There's no shortage of new skills on the table and I am doing my best to balance it all. It is a breath of fresh air and I feel rejuvenated to be learning as much as I have been and applying it in a meaningful way.
