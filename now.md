Well hello again. So you want to know what I'm up to at this very moment? You've made it to the right place. 
  
NOW is an idea I adopted from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) whom I first learned about on an episode of the [Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/). It's a simple page giving you an update about what I'm currently up to, working on, and/or interested in.

## Work 

It's been a month and a half since my depaerture from Benchling and still no luck. Thus far:  
* I've applied to 75 jobs  
* I've received 13 rejection emails  
* I've had 5 screenings/interviews 
* I have not heard from 62 of the positions I've applied for 



## Health

It's been four months since my spine surgery and I'm feeling better than ever. Thanks to Dr. Bray for giving me two new discs (C6, C7) in neck and getting back on track to doing the things I love.

It's been about a little over a month since my meniscus surgery. I'm in my fourth week of physical therapy and it's been helping tremendously.

## Learning

I've been brushing up on my python skills using DataCamp. I've also been playing around a lot with AI, mainly ChatGPT, Gemini, and Google AI Studio. I really enjoy using them as learning tools, e.g. "explain quantum physics in progressively more complex iterations", or "How do LLMs work?". However, I use them with caution as they tend to give incorrect answers not infrequently.

## Volunteering

I've fostered two dogs in the past month. The first was a 6 y/o Chihuahua mix named Henry. The other was a 1 year old Husky Mix named Tallulah. They couldn't have been more different but they were both enjoyable to have around the house.
