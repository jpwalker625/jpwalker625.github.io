Well hello again. So you want to know what I'm up to at this very moment? You've made it to the right place. 
  
NOW is an idea I adopted from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) whom I first learned about on an episode of the [Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/). It's a simple page giving you an update about what I'm currently up to, working on, and/or interested in.

## Learning

I'm continuing to develop my coding skills with DataCamp. While there is still so much to explore in R, I feel that now is finally the time to dive into Python. Wish me luck!

Understanding multiple languages is invaluable and I really respect all the people I know who are bi or multi-lingual. I am committing to using the Duolingo app for 20 minutes a day to improve my spanish language skills.

I've been shopping around for a new (used) car. At first, I thought it would make sense to get something like an SUV or smaller cross-over with AWD to accommodate my outdoorsy lifestyle. After driving my friends' VW Golf R, I realized how fun it is to drive something with such power and precision. If I'm going to be driving everyday, I might as well have fun, right? Thus I have begun looking around at similar sporty AWD sedans, mainly the Subaru WRX STI. There's only one catch; they're manual transmission. So it looks like I'll be taking a course or two to hone my stick shifting skills so that I can get out and test drive some cars!

## Volunteering

In January of 2018, I joined the Bay Area Climbers Coalition as the storage operations manager. I am proud to say I will be retaining my role for the coming year. I was much busier than I thought I would be last year and didn't get much of a chance to participate in the various stewardship events and so I am looking forward to attending more events this year. In addition, we have accummulated a lot more stuff and will be focused on improving our storage unit.

## Climbing

My goal this year is to get more focused about my climbing. I am committed to being more efficient in how I train, and being more specific when setting goals. Unfortunately, I am currently sidelined from climbing having tore my miniscus snowboarding in Whistler a few weeks ago. That doesn't mean I'm useless. There's still training to be done and will continue to do so until I'm back on the wall!
