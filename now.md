Well hello again. So you want to know what I'm up to at this very moment? You've made it to the right place. 
  
NOW is an idea I adopted from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) whom I first learned about on an episode of the [Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/). It's a simple page giving you an update about what I'm currently up to, working on, and/or interested in. 

*Updated: April 2019*

A few random updates.

I had knee surgery on April 16. The procedure went smooth and I am recovering well. I'm looking forward to getting back to my regular routine soon!

I got a new job! As of May 7, 2019 I will be working for Riffyn as a scientist. The company makes software that provides a scientific development environment allowing companies to organize workflows, integrate data, automate data anlytics, and make reporting and collaboration more streamlined. As a scientist, I will be working with our clients to integrate our software and help implement solutions throughout their entire pipeline. 

## Learning

I've finally taken the plunge into python! I'm currently using datacamp to hone my skills online through their interactive tutorials and videos.

## Volunteering

In January of 2018, I joined the Bay Area Climbers Coalition as the storage operations manager. I am proud to say I will be retaining my role for the coming year. I was much busier than I thought I would be last year and didn't get much of a chance to participate in the various stewardship events and so I am looking forward to attending more events this year. In addition, we have accummulated a lot more stuff and will be focused on improving our storage unit.

## Climbing

My goal this year is to get more focused about my climbing. I am committed to being more efficient in how I train, and being more specific when setting goals.

I applied for the North Face sponsored Live Your Dream Grant to get some assistance funding my goal to climb Denali next year.  Standing at 20,310', it is North America's tallest peak. I intend to give it a go via the West Buttress in May 2020 with Rainier Mountaineering International, a reputable guiding service.

#### Listening to

Marley Carroll. Eclectic DJ, producer who can't be boxed into one genre. I'd say he's closest to trip-hop but that doesn't do him justice. He is a talented dude and his shows are electric. Every button he pushes, every knob he turns, you can hear the effect. His scratching skills are strong and he will have you dancing his entire set. Don't miss a chance to see him live. You won't regret it.

#### Watching
*  Mr. Robot - Talented Hacker turns terrorist as he tries to overthrow the largest conglomerate in the entire world.

* Game of Thrones - Final season. Enough said.
