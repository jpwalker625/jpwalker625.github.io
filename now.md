Well hello again. So you want to know what I'm up to at this very moment? You've made it to the right place. 
  
NOW is an idea I adopted from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) whom I first learned about on an episode of the [Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/). It's a simple page giving you an update about what I'm currently up to, working on, and/or interested in.

## Work 

After two and a half exciting years at Benchling as an Enterprise Solutions Architect, I am back on the job market looking for my next role. I am interested in getting back into product management, data science, or ideally, a combination of both as I search for my next opportunity. 

## Health

It's been three months since my spine surgery and I'm feeling better than ever. Thanks to Dr. Bray for giving me two new discs (C6, C7) in neck and getting back on track to doing the things I love.

With that said, I had to go under the knife yet again to fix a meniscus tear (my third!). I'm two days out from surgery and I'm doing alright.

## Learning

I've been brushing up on my python skills using DataCamp. I've also been playing around a lot with AI, mainly ChatGPT and Google AI Studio. I really enjoy using them as learning tools, e.g. "explain quantum physics in progressively more complex iterations", or "How do LLMs work?"

## Volunteering

I love animals and I would really love to have a dog but unfortunately, I'm not sure it's going to happen anytime soon with my schedule. So instead, I recently signed up with my local animal shelter to see about fostering. I've only attended the seminar but so far, seems promising!
